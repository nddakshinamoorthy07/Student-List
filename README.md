# Create a **Student Management System** using Django. The system should allow administrators to perform CRUD operations on student records. Each student should have a name, roll number, email, and department. Implement the backend using Django models and views. Create frontend templates to display a list of students, and use forms for adding, editing, and deleting student records.
